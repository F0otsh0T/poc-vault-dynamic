# 01 - Connect to Vault

#### 

Connect to the target Vault server.

Export an environment variable for the ```vault``` CLI to address the target Vault server.

```
export VAULT_ADDR=http://0.0.0.0:8200
```

View the policies required to complete this track.

```
cat /track-files/track-policy.hcl 
# Enable secrets engine
path "sys/mounts/*" {
  capabilities = [ "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list" ]
}

# List enabled secrets engine
path "sys/mounts" {
  capabilities = [ "read", "list" ]
}

# Work with pki secrets engine
path "pki*" {
  capabilities = [ "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo" ]
}
```

Login with the ```userpass``` auth method as ```track-user```.

```
vault login -method=userpass \
  username=track-user \
  password=track-password
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.
