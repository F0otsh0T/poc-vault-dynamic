# 02 - VAULT ROLE

#### Create Read-Only Role

In the previous step you configured the PostgreSQL secrets engine with the allowed role named ```readonly```. A role is a logical name within Vault that maps to database credentials. These credentials are expressed as SQL statements and assigned to the Vault role.

Display the SQL used to create credentials stored in ```readonly.sql```.

```
cat readonly.sql
CREATE ROLE "{{name}}" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}' INHERIT;
GRANT ro TO "{{name}}";
```

The SQL contains the templatized fields ```{{name}}```, ```{{password}}```, and ```{{expiration}}```. These values are provided by Vault when the credentials are created. This creates a new role and then grants that role the permissions defined in the Postgres role named ```ro```. This PostgreSQL role was created when PostgreSQL was started.

Create the role named ```readonly``` that creates credentials with the ```readonly.sql```.

```
vault write database/roles/readonly \
>     db_name=postgresql \
>     creation_statements=@readonly.sql \
>     default_ttl=1h \
>     max_ttl=24h
Success! Data written to: database/roles/readonly
```

The role generates database credentials with a default TTL of 1 hour and max TTL of 24 hours.
