# 04 - LIFECYCLE

You will use the Vault CLI to manage credential lease lifecycle, including listing, renewing, and revoking leases.

#### Manage Leases

The credentials are managed by the lease ID and remain valid for the lease duration (TTL) or until revoked. Once revoked the credentials are no longer valid.

Login with the ```admin``` user using the ```userpass``` authentication method.

```
vault login -method=userpass \
>   username=admin \
>   password=admin-password
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Key                    Value
---                    -----
token                  s.NZiwCDusH4TonI5TRHWE5mQd
token_accessor         OYCssSngkII2xlDV1RDwfdSE
token_duration         768h
token_renewable        true
token_policies         ["admin-policy" "default"]
identity_policies      []
policies               ["admin-policy" "default"]
token_meta_username    admin
```

List the existing leases.

```
vault list sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/readonly
Keys
----
VKlWkBQ2d7WoRv26LhwoVzQC
```

All valid leases for database credentials are displayed.

Create a variable that stores the first lease ID.

```
LEASE_ID=$(vault list -format=json sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/readonly | jq -r ".[0]")
```

Renew the lease for the database credential by passing its lease ID.

```
vault lease renew database/creds/readonly/$LEASE_ID
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/readonly/VKlWkBQ2d7WoRv26LhwoVzQC
lease_duration     1h
lease_renewable    true
```

The TTL of the renewed lease is set to ```1h```.

Revoke the lease without waiting for its expiration.

```
vault lease revoke database/creds/readonly/$LEASE_ID
All revocation operations queued successfully!
```

List the existing leases.

```
vault list sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/readonly
No value found at sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/readonly/
```

The lease is no longer valid and is not displayed.

Read new credentials from the ```readonly``` database role.

```
vault read database/creds/readonly
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/readonly/bQkyV02nSNtgoHE7HZgxchEj
lease_duration     1h
lease_renewable    true
password           vzxbfA-Pk1oo260xvIKD
username           v-userpass-readonly-Vly7CCHzyui9NMd5fNwh-1646025887
```

All leases associated with a path may be removed.

Revoke all the leases with the prefix ```database/creds/readonly```.

```
vault lease revoke -prefix database/creds/readonly
All revocation operations queued successfully!
```

The ```prefix``` flag matches all valid leases with the path prefix of ```database/creds/readonly```.

List the existing leases.

```
vault list sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/readonly
No value found at sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/readonly/
```
