# 05 - PASSWORD POLICY

You will use the Vault CLI to enable a password policy that is defined in an HCL file.

#### You will use the Vault CLI to enable a password policy that is defined in an HCL file.

The database secret engines generate passwords that adhere to a default pattern that may be overridden with a new password policy. A policy defines the rules and requirements that the password must adhere to and can provide that password directly through a new endpoint or within secrets engines.

Login with the ```admin``` user using the ```userpass``` authentication method.

```
vault login -method=userpass \
>   username=admin \
>   password=admin-password
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Key                    Value
---                    -----
token                  s.w1Lu8nlVmOzWhiYzdIurKIAa
token_accessor         wrIDclV18fm29smAWBdd8fQV
token_duration         768h
token_renewable        true
token_policies         ["admin-policy" "default"]
identity_policies      []
policies               ["admin-policy" "default"]
token_meta_username    admin
```

The passwords you want to generate adhere to these requirements.

- length of 20 characters
- at least 1 uppercase character
- at least 1 lowercase character
- at least 1 number
- at least 1 symbol

Define this password policy in a file named ```example_policy.hcl```.

```
tee example_policy.hcl <<EOF
length=20

rule "charset" {
  charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  min-chars = 1
}

rule "charset" {
  charset = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
  min-chars = 1
}

rule "charset" {
  charset = "0123456789"
  min-chars = 1
}

rule "charset" {
  charset = "!@#$%^&*"
  min-chars = 1
}
EOF
```

The policy is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). The length field sets the ```length``` of the password returned to ```20``` characters. Each rule stanza defines a character set and the minimum number of occurrences those characters need to appear in the generated password. These rules are cumulative so each one adds more requirements on the password generated.

Create a Vault password policy named ```example``` with the password policy rules defined in ```example_policy.hcl```.

```
vault write sys/policies/password/example policy=@example_policy.hcl
Success! Data written to: sys/policies/password/example
```

This policy can now be accessed directly to generate a password or referenced by its name ```example``` when configuring supported secrets engines.

Generate a password from the ```example``` password policy.

```
vault read sys/policies/password/example/generate
Key         Value
---         -----
password    MT8V@263@JMHORV2Ac#b
```

The password generated adheres to the defined requirements.
Apply the password policy

Re-configure the database secrets engine with the connection credentials for the Postgres database.

```
vault write database/config/postgresql \
>      plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin \
>      connection_url="postgresql://{{username}}:{{password}}@10.42.10.104:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
>      allowed_roles=readonly \
>      username="root" \
>      password="rootpassword" \
>      password_policy="example"
```

The same connection information is used to establish the connection with the database server. The difference is that the ```password_policy``` has been set to the ```example``` policy.

Login with the ```apps``` user using the ```userpass``` authentication method.

```
ault login -method=userpass \
>   username=apps \
>   password=apps-password
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Key                    Value
---                    -----
token                  s.4Ermj63FUMK5vF1Hh7flkupq
token_accessor         wWCzThKwzYmqMH8rlxYrB5xd
token_duration         768h
token_renewable        true
token_policies         ["apps-policy" "default"]
identity_policies      []
policies               ["apps-policy" "default"]
token_meta_username    apps
```

Read credentials from the ```readonly``` database role.

```
vault read database/creds/readonly
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/readonly/doKf8h9ZoI5Y9zJb1j9fWtaj
lease_duration     1h
lease_renewable    true
password           0twYVpDGC%XYJ9prWkrM
username           v-userpass-readonly-oCMjxVvnSBEcdyqQuR2Z-1646026332
```

The credentials display the ```username``` and ```password``` generated. The ```password``` generated adheres to the example password policy defined in the secrets engine's configuration.

There are some tools available to help integrate your applications with Vault's database secrets engine. Using those tools, the existing applications may require minimum to no code change to work with Vault.
