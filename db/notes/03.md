# 03 - VAULT CLI CREDENTIALS RETRIEVAL

#### Get PostgreSQL Credentials

The applications that require the database credentials read them from the secret engine's ```readonly``` role.

View the policies required to perform the apps responsibilities in this scenario.

```
cat apps-policy.hcl
# Get credentials from the database secrets engine
path "database/creds/readonly" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
```

Login with the ```apps``` user using the ```userpass``` authentication method.

```
vault login -method=userpass \
>   username=apps \
>   password=apps-password
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Key                    Value
---                    -----
token                  s.yp3TsVC2OPhvNlANfoOvSOVY
token_accessor         ydB3SZbJ3xpaonDuhMbqPy5t
token_duration         768h
token_renewable        true
token_policies         ["apps-policy" "default"]
identity_policies      []
policies               ["apps-policy" "default"]
token_meta_username    apps
```

Read credentials from the ```readonly``` database role.

```
vault read database/creds/readonly
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/readonly/VKlWkBQ2d7WoRv26LhwoVzQC
lease_duration     1h
lease_renewable    true
password           sybQH1mqc-d0iNV6J4ua
username           v-userpass-readonly-pl1JsZMGvCecR8ifZG6C-1646025513
```

The Postgres credentials are displayed as ```username``` and ```password```. The credentials are identified within Vault by the ```lease_id```.
Validation

Connect to the Postgres database via the CLI within the ```postgres``` container.

```
docker exec -it lv-postgres psql
psql (14.1 (Debian 14.1-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

root=# 
```

Your system prompt is replaced with a new prompt ```root=#```. Commands issued at this prompt are executed against the Postgres database running within the container.

List all the database users.

```
root=# SELECT usename, valuntil FROM pg_user;
                       usename                       |        valuntil        
-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------
 root                                                | 
 v-userpass-readonly-pl1JsZMGvCecR8ifZG6C-1646025513 | 2022-02-28 06:18:38+00
(2 rows)
```

The output displays a table of all the database credentials generated. The credentials that were recently generated appear in this list.

Disconnect from the Postgres database.

```
root=# \q
```
